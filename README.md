## Description
NewBank is a banking application where customers can interact with their accounts using the command-line interface. 
Using Java, NewBank allows customers to check balances, transfer money between accounts, and send money to other 
people's bank accounts. In the future, NewBank will also offer a micro-loan service, where users can provide other 
users safe and secure micro-loans for a small fee.
